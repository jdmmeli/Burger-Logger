# Burger-Logger

For the burger enthusiast, this is a burger logging app. It allows you to create new burgers that you would like to eat, then to mark them as devoured after you have eaten them. A handy dandy way to keep track of all your favorite burgers you've had, and a roadmap to your first triple bypass surgery, all in one.
